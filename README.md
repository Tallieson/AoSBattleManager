<h1>Name</h1>
AoS Battle Manager

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Age of Sigmar is a miniature table top war game produced by Games Workshop. To play efficently, you need access to rules speread across half a dozen books, AoS Battle Manager will condense nearly all of those into 1 source. Using Python, Django, HTML/CSS, and MySQL we'll allow users to acess that content without the books, as well as create custom content for other users to use in thier own games. 

Functionality
User experience should be streamlined as possible. I want to minimized steps users need to take to find the information they need. When beginning a game of Age of Sigmar multiple things need to be determined such as:
 - Open Play/Matched Play/Narrative Play
 - Which "Realm of Battle" is it taking place on
 - What Battle Plan are you using which dictates:
    - Deployment
    - Scoring
    - Potential additonal rules/strategies
 - Terrain Features (which can be dictated by realm of battle)
 
 Upon logining in the option to create a new battle will be presented. Users starting a game will be able to randomize these options, or select them individually. 
 

Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

Data Model
What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.

Schedule
Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
